## Abstract

This CHIP will add a set of new operators to the CLVM. These operators will enable complex BLS operations, as well as new functionality such as ZK proofs.

## Definitions

Throughout this document, we'll use the following terms:
* **Chialisp** - The high-level [programming language](https://chialisp.com/) from which Chia coins are constructed
* **CLVM** - [Chialisp Virtual Machine](https://chialisp.com/clvm), where the bytecode from compiled Chialisp is executed. Also commonly refers to the compiled bytecode itself
* **BLS** - [Boneh–Lynn–Shacham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLS_digital_signature), a digital signature scheme that supports aggregation. Chia has been using [BLS keys](https://docs.chia.net/bls-keys) since before the launch of mainnet
* **G1** - The first group of points on a BLS elliptic curve; where public keys are held
* **G2** - The second group of points on a BLS elliptic curve; where digital signatures are held
* **Gt** - The target group of the G1 and G2 points, defined as `G1 x G2 → Gt`
* **ZK proofs** - [Zero-knowledge proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof), a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that a given statement is true while the prover avoids conveying any additional information apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true

## Motivation

CLVM currently includes a BLS operator called [point_add](https://chialisp.com/operators#bls12-381). This operator is used for G1 addition, and was needed to support synthetic keys. However, CLVM lacks the operators necessary to perform more complex operations, such as signature verification. 

This CHIP will add a new set of operators to CLVM in order to utilize the full capabilities of BLS signatures. For example, the new operators will add the ability to verify signatures and to use ZK proofs.

CLVM is an extensible on-chain programming language, so adding new operators is not a large technical challenge.

## Backwards Compatibility

* This CHIP requires extensive use of the [softfork](https://chialisp.com/operators/#softfork) operator
* The CLVM operators to be added are backwards compatible -- any calls that succeed after the CHIP has been implemented also would have succeeded beforehand
* The CLVM operators to be added are not forward compatible -- some calls that succeed before the CHIP has been implemented will no longer succeed afterward
* Because of the forward incompatibility of the operators to be added, this CHIP will require a soft fork of Chia's blockchain
* The block height of the soft fork will need to be determined before this CHIP can be finalized
* The operators to be added are unlikely to be contentious. However, as with all forks, there will be a risk of a chain split
* The soft fork could also fail to be adopted. This might happen if an insufficient number of nodes have upgraded to include the changes introduced by this CHIP prior to the fork's block height

## Rationale

This CHIP's design was primarily chosen for its standardized implementation. It includes consistent methods for adding, subtracting, multiplying and negating BLS points of every type. In keeping with this consistency, this proposal also includes a mapping from `point_add` to `bls_g1_add`.

Another aspect of this CHIP's design is its enhanced cross-functionality between multiple BLS groupings. The design includes the ability to pair points from different groupings, as well the ability to add arbitrary data to G1 and G2 points.

Each of the new operators will incur a CLVM cost, as detailed below. If this CHIP is adopted, the new operators will be optional when designing Chia coins.

## Specification

To support the complete set of available BLS operations within the CLVM, math primitives on G1, G2 and Gt points are required, along with functions for pairing and mapping those points. Therefore, the following operators will be added:

### bls_g1_add
 
Functionality: Add two or more G1 points

Note: This operator is already implemented in CLVM as [`point_add`](https://chialisp.com/operators#bls12-381). For consistency and ease of use, a new compiler macro will be created to map `point_add` to `bls_g1_add` so either name can be used with full backward compatibility.

## Test Cases

None so far. New test cases will be added here as they are created.

## Reference Implementation

This functionality is currently being implemented in the [bls branch](https://github.com/Chia-Network/clvm_rs/tree/bls) of the `clvm_rs` repository on GitHub.

## Security

Chia Network, Inc will need to conduct a full security audit before this CHIP can be finalized.

## Additional Assets

* Chia keys follow the [BLS-12-381](https://github.com/zkcrypto/bls12_381) standard
* Chia plots use BLS keys that are compliant with the [IRTF CFRG BLS standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-bls-signature/)
* Chia keys follow the [EIP-2333](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2333) specification, with one [minor difference](https://docs.chia.net/bls-keys/#difference-between-chia-and-eip-2333)
