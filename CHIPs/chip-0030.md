## Abstract

[CHIP-0029](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chips/pull/104) provides a method for serializing JSON data from the APIs laid out in [CHIP-0027](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chips/pull/102) into binary large object (BLOB) data. This CHIP provides a method for subdividing BLOB data into multiple chunks.

## Motivation

BLOBs used in the Chia wallet signer protocol can be too large to send in one piece. Therefore, a method is needed to subdivide, or "chunk" the data into multiple pieces. For now, this method is only used with QR codes, but in the future it could be applied more broadly to other types of BLOBs.

## Backwards Compatibility

This CHIP does not introduce any backwards incompatibilities.

## Specification

The primary method is called `create_chunks_for_blob`:

**ARGUMENTS**
```py
blob: bytes
bytes_per_chunk: int
```

**RETURNS**
The `blob`, broken into chunks of size `bytes_per_chunk`.

Each chunk is appended with [`x`, `y`], where `x` is the current chunk number, and `y` is the total number of chunks.

## Test Cases

[todo]

## Reference Implementation

This CHIP is implemented in the `hsms` GitHub repository, under [byte_chunks.py](https://github.com/Chia-Network/hsms/blob/a0e6ef2752800195d61336fb0c5e6074ee394728/hsms/util/byte_chunks.py)

## Security

CNI has conducted an internal security audit of the code from this CHIP's reference implementation.
