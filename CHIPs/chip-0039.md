## Abstract

This proposal describes a standard for fee services that attach fees when the spender doesn't have access to XCH. This service allows any spend bundle to have fees attached through a standardized protocol.

## Motivation

There are scenarios where a valid transaction cannot be submitted or will take a long time to be included in a block because there is no XCH available to pay for fees. Common scenarios include:

- Coins controlled by wallets that don't have access to XCH
- Multi-signature wallets that want to separate fee management from asset management
- Wallets that hold CATs and NFTs but no XCH
- Vaults that want to perform recovery or rekey operations without holding XCH

Currently, these systems either need to:

1. Hold XCH specifically for fees
2. Rely on manual fee attachment
3. Use custom, non-standardized fee services

A standardized fee service interface would allow any application to request fee attachment from any compatible service, improving interoperability and reducing complexity.

## Backwards Compatibility

This standard introduces new service definitions but does not modify existing blockchain behavior. It is fully backwards compatible with existing spend bundles and transaction mechanisms.

## Rationale

The design focuses on the core functionality needed to attach fees to transactions:

- Simple request/response protocol
- Minimal required fields
- Clear separation between fee attachment and transaction submission

## Specification

### Core Concepts

A fee service must provide the capability to attach fees to a spend bundle. This involves:

1. Receiving a spend bundle that requires fees
2. Creating additional coin spends to provide the necessary fees
3. Returning a new spend bundle that includes both the original spends and the fee spends

### Protocol

The fee attachment protocol consists of two main operations:

1. Fee Attachment Request
2. Fee Attachment Response

#### Fee Attachment Request

A request to attach fees must include:

- Spend Bundle
- Network identifier (e.g. mainnet, testnet11)
- Submit flag - whether to let the service submit the spend bundle or just return it

#### Fee Attachment Response

The response must include:

- Modified spend bundle with fees attached
- Amount of fees added
- Error information if the request failed

##### CLVM Conditions

Fee coin spends provided by the service may include conditions to ensure the fees cannot be separated from the spend or to assist with the running of the fees service.

Examples:

- `ASSERT_CONCURRENT_SPEND` to attach fee coins to coin spends in the original spend bundle
- `ASSERT_BEFORE_SECONDS_ABSOLUTE` to expire coin spends after an amount of time. This enables the fee service to reserve coins for a user for a limited amount of time.
- `RECEIVE_MESSAGE` to make fee spends depend on a message in the original spend bundle.

### Error Conditions

Services must handle and clearly indicate the following error conditions:

1. Invalid spend bundle format
2. Unsupported network
3. Fee calculation failures

### Implementation Requirements

Fee services should:

1. Never modify the intention or effect of the original spend bundle
2. Only add coin spends necessary for fee payment
3. Provide clear documentation of:
   - Supported networks
   - Any rate limits or restrictions
   - Error conditions and responses

### Security Requirements

Fee services should:

1. Validate all input spend bundles
2. Use secure transport (e.g. TLS)
3. Implement appropriate rate limiting

## Examples

### Basic Fee Attachment Flow

1. Client has a valid spend bundle without fees
2. Client sends spend bundle to fee service
3. Service calculates required fees
4. Service creates new coin spends for fees
5. Service combines original spend bundle with fee spends
6. Service returns complete spend bundle to client
7. Client can verify and submit the transaction

### HTTP Request/Response Examples

#### Request

```http
POST /api/fees HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "network": "mainnet",
    "spendBundle": {
        "aggregated_signature": "0x..."
        "coin_spends": [
            {
                "coin": {
                    "parent_coin_info": "0x...",
                    "puzzle_hash": "0x...",
                    "amount": 1000
                },
                "puzzle_reveal": "0x...",
                "solution": "0x..."
            }
        ],
    },
    "submit": false
}
```

#### Success Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "spendBundle": {
        "aggregated_signature": "0x...",
        "coin_spends": [
            # Original spend
            {
                "coin": {
                    "parent_coin_info": "0x...",
                    "puzzle_hash": "0x...",
                    "amount": 1000
                },
                "puzzle_reveal": "0x...",
                "solution": "0x..."
            },
            # Added fee spend
            {
                "coin": {
                    "parent_coin_info": "0x...",
                    "puzzle_hash": "0x...",
                    "amount": 100000
                },
                "puzzle_reveal": "0x...",
                "solution": "0x..."
            }
        ],
    },
    "fees": 100000,
    "submitted": false
}
```

## Test Cases

1. Basic fee attachment to a simple spend bundle
2. Fee attachment to a multiple-coin-spend transaction
3. Handling of invalid spend bundles
4. Verification that original transaction intent is preserved
5. Rate limit handling
6. Network selection validation

## Security Considerations

Fee services introduce a trust relationship - the service must be trusted to:

1. Not front-run transactions
2. Not leak transaction details
3. Provide reliable fee attachment
4. Maintain availability
5. Not modify transaction intent

Implementations should clearly document their trust model and security properties.
