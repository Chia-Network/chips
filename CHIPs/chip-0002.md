## Abstract

This proposal describes a Web3 bridge between the browser wallets and dApps on the Chia Network. 

## Motivation

More and more decentralized apps are emerging on the Chia Network. As an important entrance to Web3, a user-friendly plug-in browser wallet makes it easier for users to interact on the Chia Network. Meanwhile, dApps require access to call the user's wallet, typically from a web context.

We propose this dApp protocol for discussion with developers to improve. We hope that Chia Network's browser plug-in wallets will follow this standard to simplify the integration development of dApps.

## Backwards Compatibility

The parameters are currently passed via `JSON`, which can be modified for subsequent expansion.

## Rationale

To keep the protocol simple and flexible, we do not encapsulate the offer-related and transfer methods, but provide an underlying method called `signTransaction`. With a mature javascript/typescript library, the integration experience of wallets for dApp devs would be easy, e.g., the library can provide more features like type hint and change wallet provider.

## Goal

We manage our users' coins and private keys while maintaining the security and privacy of their funds. Our primary principle is to protect the assets' security and privacy and maintain compatibility with Chia Wallet as much as possible.

## Requirements

None.

## Specification

All methods can be called via `window.chia`, such as

```tsx
interface RequestArguments {
   method: string;
   params?: object;
}
window.chia.request(args: RequestArguments): Promise<any>;
```

The dApps and wallet use `browser.tabs.sendMessage` to communicate, the `request` function is a wrapper for the `sendMessage` function.
This proposal aims to specify an underlying API that third-party libraries can wrap like "wallet.reqestAddresses()" so that they can provide additional features, such as type hint.

## Methods

### addresses

Return a list of `standard puzzleHash`. The number of addresses returned depends on the wallet implementation. If dApp is not approved, API will return an empty list.
The dApp can build special CAT puzzleHash from the `standard puzzleHash`. The wallet can support one root key or multi-root keys either. Even in watch-only mode, the wallet can work without any root key. And the wallet can combine the addresses derived from different private keys. However, we recommend that different private keys be used separately from privacy concerns.

There is no restriction on the number of addresses the method returns. In some cases, the wallet can use many addresses internally and return 2-3 addresses.

```tsx
addresses(): string[]
```

### chainId

Return the current chainID.

| CHAIN NAME | CHAINID   |
|------------|-----------|
| Mainnet    | mainnet   |
| Testnet10  | testnet10 |

```tsx
chainId(): string
```

### connect

The dApp requests users' permission to connect the wallet. If the user rejects the request, the API will throw `userRejectdRequestError`.

```tsx
connect(): void
```

### walletSwitchChain

dApps request to switch to another chain

```tsx
walletSwitchChain(params: {chainId: string}): void
```

### selectAssetCoins
API returns the spendable coins for the selected CAT/XCH. API will return all the available coins if the amount is greater than the spendable amount.

Parameters as described below.
| Parameter | Description                                                                                                                                  |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| assetId   | The CAT1 asset id. It will be `null` if the user selects native tokens                                                                       |
| amount    | This is optional. All the coins(included locked coin) will be returned if it is missing. Otherwise, API will return the unlocked coins only. |
| excludes  | This is optional. This value is the `name` of coins.                                                                                         |

```tsx
interface SelectAssetCoinsParams {
  assetId: string|null;
  amount?: number|string;
  excludes?: string[];
}

interface CoinRecord {
  coin: Coin;
  coinName: string;
  puzzle: string;
  confirmedBlockIndex: number;
  timestamp: number;
  locked: boolean;
}

selectAssetCoins(params: SelectAssetCoinsParams): CoinRecord[]
```

### getAssetBalance
return the spendable balance of the wallet. It's convenient for the dApp to query the user's balance.

Parameters as described below.
| Parameter | Description                                                        |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| assetId   | The CAT1 asset id. It will be `null` if the user selects native tokens |

```tsx

interface AssetBalanceResp {
  confirmed: string;
  spendable: string;
  spendableCoinCount: number;
}

getAssetBalance(params: {assetId: string|null}): AssetBalanceResp

```

### getPublicKeyByAddress
return the public key asscociated with the address. If the address or the public key doesn't exist, API will throw an exception.

Parameters as described below.
| Parameter | Description                       |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| address   | the data from method `addresses`  |

```tsx
getPublicKeyByAddress(params: {address: string}): string
```

### signTransaction

This is a lower-level API that signs custom coin spends. API return a signed `SpendBundle`. Besides users' coins, it also supports the coins not owned by the user. For security purposes, the wallet should check if `coin.puzzle_hash` and `hash(puzzle_reveal)` are equal and the `conditions` generated by the coin satisfy the specification. The wallet will track the signed transactions. The coins in the transaction will be locked and not be returned in `selectAssetCoins`.

Please note that, for security purposes, the `AGG_SIGN_UNSAFE` in the `conditions` will be ignored.

Parameters as described below.
| Parameter               | Description                                                                                                                                            |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| coinSpends              | a list of `coinSpend`                                                                                                                                  |
| coinSpend.coin          | the value is `Coin`                                                                                                                                    |
| coinSpend.puzzle_reveal | the puzzle of the Coin                                                                                                                                 |
| coinSpend.solution      | the solution of puzzle                                                                                                                                 |
| broadcast               | this is optional. It means whether the wallet broadcasts the tx to the full node. If the value is `True`, an Error will be thrown if the tx is invalid |

```tsx
interface SignTransactionParams {
  coinSpends: CoinSpend[];
  broadcast?: boolean;
}

interface SignTransactionResp {
  id: string;
  transaction: SpendBundle;
}

signTransaction(params: SignTransactionParams): SignTransactionResp
```

### signMessage

Sign the message encoded as a hex string using the private key associated with the address's private key.
The internal implementation in the wallet is `bls_sign(private_key, sha256("\x18Chia Signed Message:\n" + len(message) + message))`. To prevent replay attacks, dApps should add the current `networkId` and `timestamp` into the message. If the dApp doesn't care which chain they're on, they can include the `timestamp` only.

Parameters as described below.
| Parameter | Description                       |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| message   | the hex string needs to be signed |
| address   | the data from method `addresses`  |

```tsx
interface SignMessageParams {
  message: string;
  address: string;
}

interface SignMessageResp {
  publicKey: string;
  signature: string;
}

signMessage(params: SignMessageParams): SignMessageResp
```

### pushTransaction

Even if the wallet supports `pushTransaction`, we still highly recommend that the dApp uses its full node to broadcast transactions.

```tsx
interface PushTransactionParams {
  spendBundle: SpendBundle;
}

interface PushTransactionResp {
  // mempool status, success/pending/failed
  status: string;
}

pushTransaction(params: PushTransactionParams): PushTransactionResp
```

## Events

### chainChanged

the bridge emits `chainChanged` when connecting to a new chain

```tsx
chia.on('chainChanged', listener: (chainId: string) => void)
```

### addressesChanged

the bridge emits `addressesChanged` if the addresses change account in the wallet

```tsx
chia.on('addressesChanged', listener: (addresses: string[]) => void)
```

## Types

```tsx
interface Coin {
  parent_coin_info: string;
  puzzle_hash: string;
  amount: number;
}

interface CoinSpend {
  coin: Coin;
  puzzle_reveal: string;
  solution: string;
}

interface SpendBundle {
  coin_spends: CoinSpend[];
  aggregated_signature: string;
}
```

## Errors

```tsx
interface Error {
  code: number;
  message: string;
  data?: any;
}
```

```tsx
invalidParamsError = {
  code: 4000,
  message: 'invalidParams'
}

unauthorizedError = {
  code: 4001,
  message: "unauthorized"
}

userRejectdRequestError = {
  code: 4002,
  message: "userRejectdRequest"
}

spendableBalanceExceeded = {
  code: 4003,
  message: 'spendableBalanceExceeded',
}

limitExceed = {
  code: 4029,
  message: 'too many requests'
}
```

## Test Cases

## Security

1. access control

Except for `chainId`, `addresses` and `connect`, the dApp needs the read permission of the method before calling it.

2. approval

`signTransaction`, `signMessage`, `walletSwitchChain` and `getPublicKeyByAddress` methods need to be approved by the user before calling.

## Additional Assets

None.
