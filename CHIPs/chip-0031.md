## Abstract

After a wallet has serialized and subdivided a message using the wallet signer protocol, the wallet could transport the resulting BLOB using a communication method that it has pre-established with the signer. However, the wallet signer protocol also allows wallets and signers to use additional standardized transportation methods. This CHIP provides such a method specifically for transporting QR codes.

## Motivation

This CHIP is narrowly focused on QR code transportation. However, more CHIPs could be added as additional needs arise, such as transportation using a third-party service or a push notification.

## Backwards Compatibility

This CHIP does not introduce any backwards incompatibilities.

## Specification

This CHIP uses the python [segno](https://pypi.org/project/segno/) library to make QR codes and rotate them in place every 2 seconds or so. The frequency of rotation is configurable upon running the `segno` command.

## Reference Implementation

This CHIP is implemented in [signer.py](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/blob/f6c42e9f76f40bcad2596ca567875378b12eb107/chia/cmds/signer.py#L45-L46).

## Security

CNI has conducted an internal security audit of the code from this CHIP's reference implementation.
