## Abstract

This CHIP is a translation layer that reduces the maximal set of wallet protocol APIs from `CHIP-0027` into an optimal set of APIs for one or more signers. This CHIP is designed specifically for blind signers, which only include signature targets, and not anything about the spends.

## Motivation

Multiple types of signers will likely use the APIs from `CHIP-0027`. Each signer type will require a separate CHIP to standardize a method for translating the APIs. This CHIP focuses narrowly on blind signers.

## Backwards Compatibility

This CHIP does not introduce any backwards incompatibilities.

## Rationale

This CHIP is targeted at developers of blind signers, in order to provide them with a standard method to translate the wallet protocol API into a smaller form.

## Specification

### Types

This section lists the relevant APIs from CHIP-0027, along with their replacements in this CHIP.

#### signing_target

CHIP-0027 version:

```py
{
  "pubkey": "..."
  "message": "..."
  "hook": "..."
}
```

This CHIP:

```py
{
  "p": "..."
  "m": "..."
  "h": "..."
}
```

#### sum_hint

CHIP-0027 version:

```py
{
  "fingerprints": ["..."]
  "synthetic_offset": "..."
}
```

This CHIP:

```py
{
  "f": ["..."]
  "o": "..."
}
```

#### path_hint

CHIP-0027 version:

```py
{
  "root_fingerprint": "..."
  "path": ["..."]
}
```

This CHIP:

```json
{
  "f": "..."
  "p": ["..."]
}
```

#### signing_instructions

CHIP-0027 version:

```py
{
  "key_hints": <key_hints>
  "targets": [<signing_target>]
}
```

This CHIP:

```py
{
  "s": [<sum_hint>]
  "p": [<path_hint>]
  "t": [<signing_target>]
}
```

#### unsigned_transaction

CHIP-0027 version:

```py
{
  "transaction_info": <transaction_info>
  "signing_instructions": <signing_instructions>
}
```

This CHIP:

```py
{
  "s": [<sum_hint>]
  "p": [<path_hint>]
  "t": [<signing_target>]
}
```

#### signing_response

CHIP-0027 version:

```py
{
  "signature": "..."
  "hook": "..."
}
```

This CHIP:

```py
{
  "s": "..."
  "h": "..."
}
```

## Reference Implementation

This CHIP is implemented in [blind_signer_tl.py](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/blob/385916a6a29c5124155b43cb7cfe48c6ec7b3590/chia/wallet/util/blind_signer_tl.py).

## Security

CNI plans to conduct an internal audit of this code when it is ready.
